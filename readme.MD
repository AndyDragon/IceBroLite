I've started writing a [manual](manual.MD)!

Most information below might be outdated, I haven't updated this as I've updated the code.

# Releases

Releases have moved to github [releases](https://github.com/Sakrac/IceBroLite/releases/)

### Differences from IceBro

IceBro Lite doesn't contain its own 6502 emulator for debugging "post mortem" which makes it a lot simpler to understand. When it is ready it should function similar to the command line monitor of vice only with a graphical user interface and more visualizations of the current state.

### Status

Testing release candidates, wrapping up documentation
