# IceBro Lite

I've started writing a [manual](manual.MD)!

Most information below might be outdated, I haven't updated this as I've updated the code.

Debugger is showing FrostBite code and art from Tony Savona, Saul Cross and STE'86. This is used because Kick Assembler has better debug information and I'm not using it for my personal projects.

# Releases

Releases have moved to github [releases](https://github.com/Sakrac/IceBroLite/releases/)

### Differences from IceBro

IceBro Lite doesn't contain its own 6502 emulator for debugging "post mortem" which makes it a lot simpler to understand. When it is ready it should function similar to the command line monitor of vice only with a graphical user interface and more visualizations of the current state.

### Status

Currently testing the latest pre-release to figure out anything blocking a full first release.
